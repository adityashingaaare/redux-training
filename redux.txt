Redux 
    it is used to store manage and track state of js apps
    it is open source javascript library

    it works on three main concepts-
        1. store : It holds state of application
        2. action : It describes changes with state
        3. reducer : It actually carry out state transition depending on store and action

    install Redux
    >npm i Redux


    action: 
        - it is plain js Object
        - containing type property with string constant value

    reducer:
        - it is a function which takes two parameters
            1. state of application 
            2. action
        
        reducer(state,action);

    store: 
        - it stores store in it
        - getState() returns initial state
        - getDispatch() return updated state
        - to access state in js app, we hae to subscribe first
        - and at last unsubscribe

    >npm i react-Redux
